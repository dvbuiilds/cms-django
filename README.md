## Simple Content Management System in Django
With the vision to make the blogging hassle free and the blogs more interactive to the audience of the user, we have started building tis project.

As you create a post being a user, you can skip adding caption (as many times, thinking about the right caption sucks) and this tool will do the caption job for you. ;)

# Steps to Install this repository Locally

1. Star Mark the Repo. ;)
2. Fork the repo by clicking the trident symbol on the top. You'll get a duplicate repo on your account pointing to this repo.
3. Clone your copy of repo and make a local copy.
4. Install Python latest version. (Mine is 3.10)
5. Create venv : ```python -m venv env```
6. Install the required packages: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```. This will take a while.
7. Finally run the server: ```python manage.py runserver```
