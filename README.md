## Simple Content Management System in Django
With the vision to make the blogging hassle free and the blogs more interactive to the audience of the user, we have started building tis project.

As you create a post being a user, you can skip adding caption (as many times, thinking about the right caption sucks) and this tool will do the caption job for you. ;)
